**Overview**

This repository contains multiple data science and machine learning projects, focusing on data cleaning, machine learning model training and evaluation, time series forecasting, and deep learning applications. The projects are built around several datasets and leverage various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to solve classification, prediction, and image recognition tasks.

**Project Structure**

The repository is organized into the following main projects:

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

The code in this section demonstrates how to handle uncleaned datasets by implementing data cleaning techniques, including missing value imputation, outlier handling, and feature engineering. The methods are applied to real-world datasets to transform raw data into a form suitable for machine learning.

Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation
This section includes implementations of multiple supervised learning algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

Na√Øve Bayes

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

These algorithms are used to train models on datasets like **[Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)** and **[Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)**. Each model is evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to assess performance and identify the best performing model for the given dataset.

**Time Series Forecasting Models**

This project involves comparing the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for stock price prediction. The project highlights how LSTM and ARIMA handle temporal dependencies and explores their accuracy in forecasting future stock prices based on historical data.

**Convolutional Neural Networks for Facial Recognition**

A deep learning project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for facial recognition tasks. The project includes pre-processing facial images, building CNN models, and training the models to achieve high recognition accuracy. The implementation demonstrates how CNNs can learn complex features of facial images, making them highly effective for image classification and recognition tasks.
